    <h2>What is Frozen Yogurt?</h2>
    <p>Frozen yogurt, or "fro-yo," is a chilled dessert made from yogurt, milk, sugar, and flavorings, offering a tangy
        alternative to ice cream with often less fat but potentially high sugar, especially with toppings. It's known
        for its tart flavor from live cultures and creamy texture, achieved through whipping during freezing, and can
        contain beneficial probiotics, but its health profile depends heavily on ingredients and toppings. </p>
    <h2>Key characteristics</h2>
    <p>Base: Made with cultured milk, unlike ice cream's cream base, giving it a distinct tartness.
        Texture: Whipped during freezing for fluffiness, with added ingredients like corn syrup, cream, or stabilizers
        making it smoother.
        Health aspects: Contains protein, calcium, and probiotics (good bacteria) that aid digestion, though sugar and
        calorie content vary significantly.
        Variations: Can be made low-fat, nonfat, sugar-free, vegan, or dairy-free to suit dietary needs.
        Serving: Often served self-serve with a wide variety of toppings, which can add significant sugar and calories,
        notes Healthline. </p>
    <h2>How it differs from ice cream</h2>

    <p>Frozen yogurt (froyo) uses cultured milk for a tangy flavor and lighter feel, while ice cream uses cream,
        making it richer and smoother; froyo is often lower in fat/calories but can have more sugar, and ice cream
        must meet a minimum 10% milkfat content by FDA rules, giving it a fluffier texture. Key differences are in
        dairy base (yogurt vs. cream), texture (tangy/lighter vs. rich/creamy), and nutritional profile (often less
        fat in froyo, but check labels for sugar/calories). </p>

    <h2>Here's some fun info about frozen yogurt:</h2>
    <h3>HEALTH PROFILE: </h3>
    Frozen yogurt can be a healthier alternative to ice cream, particularly for those wanting to limit fat, as it is
    often lower in fat. However, the healthiness depends on the specific product and added ingredients.
    Considerations: Choose options that are lower in added sugar and artificial colors to maximize health benefits.
    Lactose intolerance: Some people with lactose intolerance may find frozen yogurt easier to digest than regular ice
    cream because the fermentation process can lower the lactose content.
    <h3>PRICING: </h3>Many shops charge by weight, so be mindful of the toppings you add. The cost of the container
    itself is usually subtracted before weighing.

    flavors and high ratings.

    Cream also offer frozen yogurt or similar frozen desserts.
